SmartDMS – AI Powered Smart Document Management System

SmartDMS is an AI-powered document management platform that automatically reads, extracts, and organizes information from uploaded documents such as receipts, medical reports, bills, and PDFs.
Instead of manually entering data or managing scattered files, users can simply upload a document and the system will intelligently process it using OCR and AI to extract key information like names, amounts, dates, and expiry details. The extracted data is then structured, categorized, and stored securely, while also generating useful insights such as expense summaries and upcoming alerts.
The platform combines modern web technologies with artificial intelligence to create a seamless document automation workflow.

Document Processing Pipeline
User uploads an image or PDF document.
The frontend sends the file to the FastAPI backend.
The backend preprocesses the document using OpenCV.
EasyOCR extracts raw text from the document.
Google Gemini AI analyzes the text and converts it into structured data.
The AI categorizes the document into predefined folders.
Extracted data and document metadata are stored in the SQLite database.
The frontend dashboard displays results, insights, and alerts.

How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps if you want to run the project on your system.

1. Clone the Repository
  https://github.com/Meemansa2601/Smart-Document-Management-System

 cd SmartDMS

3. Setup the Backend
